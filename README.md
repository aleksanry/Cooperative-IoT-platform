# 🔧 Smart IoT Edge System – Phase 1 Development

🚧 **Status:** *Work in Progress*  
👤 **Author:** Individual project by Nermin M.  
📅 **Current Phase:** Phase 1 – Device Layer + Basic Edge

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to build a decentralized, cooperative IoT platform that eliminates vendor lock-in, ensures business continuity, and gives hardware companies full ownership and control of their IoT infrastructure    


This is a modular and forward-looking IoT system designed for smart, scalable, and secure deployments. The project is structured in clear phases to ensure reliable edge communication, robust hardware integration, and eventual support for cloud and blockchain extensions.

We're starting **where it matters most**: the device layer. Early focus on the edge ensures fast feedback loops, real-world testing, and a strong technical foundation for everything to come.

##  Current Objectives – Phase 1: Device Layer + Basic Edge

###  Why Start Here?

- **Fast Results**: Functional hardware + data flow in days  
- **Core Stability**: Early protocol setup ensures long-term reliability  
- **Momentum Builder**: Real progress you can demo and iterate on  
- **Foundation for Scaling**: Edge first, then cloud + blockchain

##  Why This Architecture?

- **Hardware First**: Tackle integration and physical-layer issues early  
- **Layered Complexity**: Each step builds logically on the last  
- **Real Testing**: Stress-test protocols with real-world data  
- **Cost Efficient**: Start lean, validate fast, then expand  

---

##  Tech Stack (Phase 1)

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32
- **Protocols**: MQTT
- **Edge Server**: Raspberry Pi (broker + local interface)
- **Tools**: Arduino IDE, Mosquitto, Flask (for web UI), OTA modules

##  What’s Next?

After Phase 1 is complete:
- Advanced edge processing
- Encrypted cloud sync
- Blockchain-backed data integrity
- Scalable device management
